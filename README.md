# Roberto Hoyle's Publications

The overriding theme of my research interests have been studying how people communicate with each other and how they can better protect the information that they want to keep to themselves.  Lately, I have moved into how one can extend the benefits of privacy research into populations that are under-represented in research studies, and ways in which they may be able to benefit from targeted contributions.

Items marked with an '*' are from work conducted in graduate school.

## Privacy of Marginalized Populations

In this area, I looked into concerns of transgender individuals and how their concerns are not addressed by current privacy research, as well as looking into guidelines in how to responsibly design research studies to meet the needs of the research subjects.

## Privacy of People with Visual Impairment

This area follow the theme of under-represented populations in security research, and how to identify their needs.

## Image Sharing and Lifelogging

This area of research looked into how image sharing can be performed in a privacy-preserving way.
